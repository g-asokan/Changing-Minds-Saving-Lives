# Changing-Minds-Saving-Lives
Studying the ReOpen movement during quarantine on Facebook and the misinformation surrounding it.

We were taken aback by the ReOpen protests in response to the quarantine lockdown, on the urging of Boston University Professor Jeremy Menchik we decided to examine the national Facebook group : ReOpen USA 2020 and analyze the language being used and the type of information being shared via NLP tools.
